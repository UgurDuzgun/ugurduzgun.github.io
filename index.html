            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I opened my eyes to life in 2002 in Izmir, where I was born and raised. I have had a great interest in cars and motor sports since my childhood. My interest in the world of automobiles started from a young age by looking at car prices on ad sites and examining vehicles on the internet. Over time, I mediated many vehicle sales and gained experience in this field. I know the features of today's cars, their operating principles, costs and which model is suitable for what.

                Additionally, I improved my sales and marketing skills with the experiences I gained using it. I trained myself in persuasion and information and became a consultant to whom everyone around me could answer their questions about automobiles. My desire to share my passion and knowledge has allowed many people to get to know me through automobiles.
                
                My interest in software started to increase during my high school years and I enrolled in the Computer Programming department at Izmir University of Economics. During this period, I improved myself in the field of software and computer science and graduated. I took part in various projects throughout my school life and had the opportunity to get to know and learn many software languages.
                
                I am currently preparing myself for an IT-related profession in the automotive industry. Also, I am a Business Management student at Anadolu University and I am in the final stage of my graduation. I am preparing for the future with the knowledge and experience I have gained during this process and I am taking step by step to realize my dreams.</p>
